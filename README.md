# frc-subsystems

This repository consists of several fundamental FRC subsystems that could be found on an FRC robot. It does not include complex systems that would be used for specific game modes, but it does include generic guidelines (especially for intake and gearboxes) that can be morphed into whatever may be necessary for the task at hand.
